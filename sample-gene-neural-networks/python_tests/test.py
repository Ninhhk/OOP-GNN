This is a python script for integration testing our sample app.

Execution requirements:

  1. Start Cytoscape from the command line with the -R option set to 1234 (normally './cytoscape.sh -R 1234' or 
     './cytoscape.sh -R 1234')
  2. Using the Cytoscape App Manager, ensure that CyREST is installed, and is up to date.
  3. Install your sample app jar through the Cytoscape App Manager by using the 'Install from file...' button
  4. Execute this script

You should get console output that says looks something like the folllowing:
  
  Ran 2 tests in 0.042s
  
  OK
  
  Process finished with exit code 0

This indicates that your app has passed the 2 tests we have written below.
